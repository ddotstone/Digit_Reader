# Digit_Reader
A low level neural network implementation that can interpret hand written images through pixel intensity.

This projects uses a simple neural network implementation in order to train itself to recognize handwritten digits. 
The project is trained from the mnist database, using stochastic gradient descent as well as backdrop in order to
quickly learn.

The program then tests the results of the trained neural network against a test set of handwritten digits. The results of these tests
are there printed to the console. The program is able to reach 95.6% accuracy, and with improvements will be able to hit much higher.
